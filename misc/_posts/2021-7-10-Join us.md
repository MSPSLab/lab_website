> Team introduction:

- Prof. Minyi Xu's team in the School of Marine Engineering of Dalian Maritime University is dedicated to the basic and applied research of nanogenerators in the field of ship and marine engineering. Recently, members of the team have designed various forms of energy harvesting devices based on friction nanogenerators to achieve efficient harvesting of wave energy [1], vibration energy [2], noise energy [3] and low-grade water energy [4]. In addition, self-driven wave sensors [5], ship water level sensors [6] and flow sensors [7] have been developed.
