# Abstract

In recent years, remarkable strides have been achieved in the advancement of nanogenerators harnessing fluid-induced vibrations. This article comprehensively undertakes a methodical exploration of the latest advancements in the nanogenerator research centered around fluid-induced vibrations. To commence, the foundational principles of piezoelectric generation, contact electrification and fluid-induced vibration are elucidated, laying the groundwork for subsequent discourse. Following this, the article systematically categorizes manifold applications of piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) within the realm of fluid-induced vibrations. This categorization offers insights into the diverse scenarios where these nanogenerators exhibit efficacy, further enriching the understanding of their potential. The theme of categorization extends the understanding of PENG and TENG applications within fluid-induced vibrations, augmenting the reader's grasp of their versatility and functional mechanisms. Subsequently, a comprehensive comparison of PENG and TENG is carried out to clarify the current challenges and provide suggestions for future development. Notably, the article highlights the growing significance of these technologies in fostering sustainable energy solutions. Its comprehensive analysis and systematic classification serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners alike, propelling the field towards innovative applications and breakthroughs.
