# Abstract

An enormous number of wireless sensing nodes (WSNs) are of great significance for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is tremendously prospective to realize the in-situ power supply of WSNs by harvesting unutilized mechanical vibration energy. A harmonic silicone rubber triboelectric nanogenerator (HSR-TENG) is developed focusing on ubiquitous constant working frequency machinery. The unique design of the strip serving as a flexible resonator realizes both soft contact and high and broadband output. The significant factors influencing the 1st-order vibration mode of the strip are developed for realizing the harmonic frequency adaptation to external vibration. The surface treatment of the strip improves the output performance of HSR-TENG by 49.1% as well as eliminates the adhesion effect. The HSR-TENG is able to achieve a voltage output bandwidth of 19 Hz under a vibration strength of 3.0, showing its broadband capability. The peak power density of 153.9 W/m3 is achieved and 12 Ã— 0.5 W light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully illuminated by the HSR-TENG. It can continuously power a temperature sensor by harvesting the actual compressor vibration energy. In brief, the HSR-TENG provides a promising way for constant frequency vibration energy harvesting, so as to achieve in-situ power supply for the WSNs in the vicinity.
