# Abstract

Indoor air quality plays a critical role in maintaining human health and well-being. In this study, a novel self-powered and high-efficiency negative air ion (NAI) generator in pipeline is proposed for air purification in the ventilation system. The self-power is achieved by utilizing a novel device of wind energy triboelectric nanogenerator (WE-TENG) to efficiently harvest wind energy in the pipeline. The present WE-TENG of investigation can reach a high rotation speed of 1300 rpm at 5.5 m/s in the pipe with a pressure drop of 175 Pa. After the power management circuit, the self-powered NAI generator is capable to drive 21 carbon-fiber electrodes to generate NAIs, with a generation rate of 23.14 Î¼C/s. The self-powered NAI generator efficiently generates a high volume of NAIs in the pipeline, harnessing the air-purifying properties of NAIs, thereby making a significant impact on the practical application of self-powered indoor air purification systems based on TENG.
