# Abstract

With the development of intelligent ship, types of advanced sensors are in great demand for monitoring the work conditions of ship machinery. In the present work, a self-powered and highly accurate vibration sensor based on bouncing-ball triboelectric nanogenerator (BB-TENG) is proposed and investigated. The BB-TENG sensor consists of two copper electrode layers and one 3D-printed frame filled with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) balls. When the sensor is installed on a vibration exciter, the PTFE balls will continuously bounce between the two electrodes, generating a periodically fluctuating electrical signals whose frequency can be easily measured through fast Fourier transform. Experiments have demonstrated that the BB-TENG sensor has a high signal-to-noise ratio of 34.5 dB with mean error less than 0.05% at the vibration frequency of 10 Hz to 50 Hz which covers the most vibration range of the machinery on ship. In addition, the BB-TENG can power 30 LEDs and a temperature sensor by converting vibration energy into electricity. Therefore, the BB-TENG sensor can be utilized as a self-powered and highly accurate vibration sensor for condition monitoring of intelligent ship machinery.
