# Abstract

Pressure sensors are widely used in various industrial automatic-control environments. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the requirements for environmental adaptability and reliability of pressure sensors in IoT applications are also increasing; moreover, pressure sensors are challenged by the energy supply problem. In this regard, a triboelectric pressure sensor has the remarkable characteristic of being self-powered. It is highly sensitive, stable, and environmentally adaptable, all of whose features are of considerable significance for fully adapting to the development needs of IoT. The environmental adaptability and performance stability of triboelectric pressure sensors in information sensing systems are gradually increasing, which also puts forward higher requirements for material selection and processing technology. In this study, the basic working principle, structural design, electrode material, processing technology, sensing characteristics, and various application scenarios of triboelectric pressure sensors are systematically and comprehensively summarised. Furthermore, following a novel approach, triboelectric pressure sensors are divided into four types according to the electrode materials: conductor, semiconductor, hybrid, and hydrogel electrodes. Finally, the existing challenges and future application prospects are discussed in depth. The study findings can contribute to promoting further developments in the field.
