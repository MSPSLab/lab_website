# Abstract


Soft pumps have the potential to transform industries including soft robotics, wearable devices, microfluidics and biomedical devices, but their efficiency and power supply limitations hinder prolonged operation. Here, we report a self-powered triboelectric-electrohydrodynamic pump, which combines a soft electrohydrodynamic pump driven by an electrostatic generator, specifically a triboelectric nanogenerator. The triboelectric nanogenerator collects ambient energy and converts it into high-voltage power source, allowing it to self-power an electrohydrodynamic pump and thus eliminating the need for external power supply. Using power management circuit, geometric shape optimization, and stacking methods, we achieve a maximum pressure of 4.49 kPa and a maximum flow rate of 502 mL/min. We demonstrate the pump’s versatility in applications such as self-powered soft actuators, oil pumping in microfluidics, and oil purification. The triboelectric-electrohydrodynamic pump holds promising applications, and offers new insights for the development of fully self-powered systems.
