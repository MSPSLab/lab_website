# Abstract

In recent years, sensors have been moving towards the era of intelligence, miniaturization and low power consumption, but the power-supply problem has always been a key issue restricting the popularization and development of machine-mounted sensors on the rotating machinery. Herein, we develop a ring-type triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG) that functions as a sustainable power source as well as a self-powered rotational speed sensor for rotating machinery. The R-TENG adopts a freestanding mode and consists of a ring-type container unit, an end cover and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cylinders. In this study, the influence of the number of cylinders, the PTFE cylinder’s diameter and the rotational speed on the electrical output are systematically examined, and the motion law of the PTFE cylinders in the container is revealed by the experimental results and verified by kinetic simulation. At a rotational speed of 400 rpm, the output voltage, current and transferred charge of the designed R-TENG reached 138 V, 115 nC and 2.03 μA, respectively. This study provides an attractive power supply strategy for machine-mounted sensors of the rotating machinery, and the rotational speed measurement test also suggests the potential application of the R-TENG as a self-powered rotational speed sensor.
