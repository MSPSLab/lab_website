- 题目：非匀速运动介质系统中的动生麦克斯韦方程组

- As inspired by the invention of the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), interests in the study of electromagnetic behaviour of moving media have been revived because of the newly observed experimental phenomena. The conventional Max-well's equations are for media whose boundaries and volumes are fixed and at stationary. The special relativity is most effective for dealing with the field of moving media that are along a straight line at a constant speed (e.g., inertia reference frame). But for moving media that have specific sizes, shapes and may move with accelerations in engineering, the Maxwell's equations may have to be expanded. Here, starting from the integral form of the Maxwell's equations for general cases, we first derived the Maxwell's equations for a mecha-
no-driven slow-moving media system with considering the coupling among mechano-electric-magnetic fields. Secondly, the displacement vector is expanded to include the mechano-driven polarization density term owing to media movement, based on which the theory for TENGs is developed.
